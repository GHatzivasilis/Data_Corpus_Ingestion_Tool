# Data_Corpus_Ingestion_Tool
This is the open-source implementation of the **Ingestion Tool** for the **MARVEL Data Corpus** (https://datacorpus.marvel-project.eu/).
The Data Corpus was implemented under the EU Funded project MARVEL (_GA-957337_), and is a collection of audio/video datasets from smart cities.
Most of the data are gathered by survaillance systems of public spaces (e.g., squares, parks, roads, parking spots, etc.).

The Ingestion Tool can be used by users in order to contribute to our community by uploading their own datasets or to download datasets programmaticaly.
In order to use the tool, **one needs to have valid credentials**. For this, **contact the MARVEL administrators** in the following link: https://www.marvel-project.eu/contact/.
