# Data_Corpus_Ingestion_Tool
This is the open-source implementation of the Ingestion Tool for the MARVEL Data Corpus (https://datacorpus.marvel-project.eu/).
The Data Corpus was implemented under the EU Funded project MARVEL (GA-957337), and is a collection of audio/video datasets from smart cities.
Most of the data are gathered by survaillance systems of public spaces (e.g., squares, parks, roads, parking spots, etc.).
